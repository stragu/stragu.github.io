<p>I am currently working at the University of Queensland as a research officer in the <a href="http://epngroup.org/">Ecophysiology and Plant Nutrition group</a> (School of Agriculture and Food Sciences). I am looking into starting a PhD that will hopefully have something to do with plants, taxonomy, computer vision, machine learning and citizen science.</p>

<p>I also am a <a href="https://studio-dessai.github.io/">radio presenter</a> and a volunteer at the beautiful <a href="http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/facilities-recreation/parks-venues/parks/brisbane-botanic-gardens-mount-coot-tha">Mt Coot-tha botanic gardens</a>, mostly identifying and mounting plant specimens.</p>

<p>Oh, and I sometimes <a href="https://soundcloud.com/jesuisgentil">make sounds</a> and <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/GNTL/">put songs together</a>.</p>

My interests mainly fit in the following catefories:
<ul>
  <li>Plants</li>
  <li>Free software</li>
  <li>Free culture</li>
  <li>Radio</li>
  <li>Electronic and experimental music</li>
  <li>Sustainability</li>
</uL>

I might eventually write a few...

  <h1 class="page-heading">...posts</h1>

  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in site.posts %}
      <li>
        <span class="post-meta">{{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }}</span>

        <h2>
          <a class="post-link" href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </h2>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

  <p class="rss-subscribe">subscribe <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">via RSS</a></p>
